# Domoticz Lua scripts
Collection of domoticz lua scripts, currently consisting of:

- `script_time_radar.lua`: Radar detection and alerting on specified roads (Netherlands only)

## Installation:
Put the scripts you want inside your domoticz lua scripts folder:

Keep the name of the script filenames the same, and they will be 
triggered every minute (actual code execution every x minutes can 
be set inside every script).
